**Libft: A Versatile C Library**


## Overview

"Libft" is a versatile C library that I designed and implemented to provide fundamental functionality for C programming tasks. This project showcases my proficiency in low-level programming and my ability to create reusable code to expedite development in future projects.

## Description

"Libft" serves as a comprehensive collection of custom C functions that replicate standard library functions and introduces additional utility functions. The library covers a wide range of functionality, including string manipulation, memory management, linked list operations, and character handling.

The library is designed to be a powerful extension to the standard C library, providing users with essential tools for their C programming needs. Each function is meticulously crafted to ensure efficiency, robustness, and portability across various platforms.

As part of this project, I implemented standard functions such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, and `malloc`, as well as custom functions like linked list operations (`ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`, etc.) and character checks (`ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalpha`, etc.).

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Functionality**: "Libft" provides a wide array of functions to handle strings, memory, linked lists, and character operations, making it a valuable resource for C developers.

- **Efficient and Robust**: Each function is optimized for efficiency and designed to handle edge cases, ensuring reliable performance in practical applications.

- **Code Reusability**: By creating a self-contained library of utility functions, "Libft" promotes code reusability and simplifies development in future C projects.

- **Unit Testing**: I conducted thorough unit testing on each function to verify correctness and guarantee the library's reliability.

## Outcome

Developing "Libft" has allowed me to delve deep into the intricacies of C programming, understanding memory management, and improving my proficiency in low-level operations. The project serves as a testament to my dedication to producing well-structured, efficient, and portable code.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
